generator-wp-grunted-theme
==========================

A WordPress theme YeoMan generator, to kickstart WordPress theme development with yo, sass and grunt

A generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).

## Getting Started

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

To install generator-wp-grunted-theme from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-wp-grunted-theme
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo generator-wp-grunted-theme
```
